Site is powered by Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/)

To build the site and make it available on a local server, just run:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

Note: you might need to run `bundle install` in case some gems are missing.

Now you can browse to http://localhost:4000 and preview the site.

To add a new blog post, you can do it by just adding a new markdown file in the `_posts` folder with the required config in the header.

For adding new sections or changing the layout, you can contact us at consult@dev-harbor.com
