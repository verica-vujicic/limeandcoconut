My sister recently gave birth to a healthy and beautiful little girl called Sonya. Sonya has this small pinkish V-shaped marking on her forehead, right between her eyebrows. The doctors said it is a common birthmark found in infants, and it’s called an angel kiss. Is the angel kiss harmful or just another skin mark as cute as it looks? Although most types of birthmarks are harmless and do not require any treatment, some types may cause health problems later on in a baby’s life.

Baby’s skin is like a book. You can tell a great deal of information just from watching their skin changing colors. Color changing depends on the baby’s health and the environment. It shows a baby’s race and ethnic origin, age, temperature, or whether or not a baby is crying, grunting or straining. Most of the skin colors will disappear over time. Birthmarks may also come and go, but some may stick around for a long time, even a lifetime.

## What Are Birthmarks

Birthmarks are flat or bumpy, discolored skin marks that appear at birth or within a first few months afterward. They may appear anywhere on the face or body and may vary in size, color, and bumpiness. All other skin markings noted later in life are not considered as birthmarks.

## How Common Are They

Birthmarks are indeed very common. Studies have shown that 10% of all newborns have birthmarks. Some types are more common than others. For example, a birthmark known as Hemangioma can be found in more than half of all babies born with birthmarks.

## What Causes Them

There is no reasonable explanation for the appearance of the birthmark. Some may be inherited, but most are not. One thing is undoubted - it has nothing to do with the mother’s behavior during pregnancy. They are rarely related to skin trauma during childbirth.

## Types Of Birthmarks

There are two major types of birthmarks - vascular and congenital birthmarks. Keep in mind that the birthmark of any of the following types is darker on darker skin.

## Vascular birthmarks - red, pink, purple

Vascular birthmarks are the accumulation of extra blood vessels. These immature and tiny blood vessels may group and present on the skin as a little red bump, but most of them are flat. Several types of vascular birthmarks are defined:

## Salmon patches

- Also known as angel kiss or stork bite
- Very common
- Flat birthmark located on eyelid, forehead, between eyebrows, back of the neck, upper lip
- More visible when baby’s crying or grunting
- Fades away in the first two years (if not on the neck); those located on the back of the neck may last longer

Fun Fact! 
Stork bite refers to a birthmark on the back of the baby’s neck. According to the legend, a stork left a marking while picking up and delivering a baby to the parents.

## Hemangiomas

- Also known as strawberry or cherry
- Raised bright red or dark red lump
- Mostly located on the head
- More common in babies born before 37 pregnancy weeks, in girls, low birth weight babies, twins, and other multiple births
- May appear on the birth, or in the first couple of months
- Usually growing for several months
- Gradually fading and fade away completely by the age of adolescence usually leaving a pale mark

## Port-wine stains

- Flat red, pink or purple birthmarks present from birth
- Occur on the head or neck
- Do not change color under pressure 
- Do not disappear over time
- Become thicker and darker over time
- May be associated with serious medical conditions
- Usually require cosmetic attention (for smaller strains), or usage of a special type of laser (for bigger birthmarks)


## Pigmented birthmarks - brown

Pigmented birthmarks occur as a result of the overgrowth of the pigment skin cells, similarly to moles. One subtype is indeed a kind of a mole:

## Congenital moles

- Brown or black, rarely pinkish  
- Flat or raised, typically rounded
- Very common, it occurs in 1 of 100 newborns
- May become large, thicker and hairy, especially in adolescence
- May disappear over time
- Rarely, the changes may lead to skin cancer
- Do not need treatment unless there’s a risk of cancer (risk increases with the mole size)

## Café au lait spots

- Light or dark flat patches, color similar to café au lait (French for “coffee with milk”)
- Common birthmark, many kids having 1 or 2
- Mostly oval or elliptical but vary in size and shape
- If more than five café au lait appear by the age of 5, a baby may be diagnosed with neurofibromastosis

## Mongolian blue spots

- Blue, grey, purple, bruised-looking markings presented from birth
- Usually located on buttocks or lower back, arms and legs
- More common in babies with darker skin
- Harmless
- Disappear by the age of 4

## Can Birthmarks Be Harmful

Most birthmarks are harmless and disappear over time. Long-term birthmarks may cause certain esthetic discomfort, so the people reach out for cosmetic procedures rather than medical help later in life. Nevertheless, some birthmarks such as port-wine stains may stay for a lifetime and cause health issues, if not treated. In the case of congenital moles, a birthmark may change over time and trigger a cancerous process on the skin. Certain types are signs of serious medical conditions. 

Some port-wine strains are associated with mostly genetic syndromes: 

- Sturge-Weber syndrome - affects the eyes and brain
- Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome - blood vessels didn’t form properly
- Macrocephaly-capillary malformation - abnormalities of the skin, vascular system, brain, and limbs

A port-wine strain may cause glaucoma if located near the eye and pressuring an eyeball. Café au lait may be a sign of neurofibromatosis if five or more patches are present on the baby’s skin. Multiple hemangiomas often indicate that there are internal hemangiomas, too. Internal vascular birthmarks may be irritated, cause bleeding, or even infection.

## Should Birthmarks Be Treated

Your baby will be examined thoroughly at birth. Your child’s healthcare provider will follow up and closely monitor if there are:

- Birthmarks located near the middle of the back, right up to a spine (to check spinal cord condition)
- Large birthmarks on head or neck
- Birthmarks that may affect breathing, feeding or vision
- Several birthmarks

Unless there is a diagnosis of a medical condition, birthmarks do not require treatment. However, if you notice any changes that concern you, contact your pediatrician.

## Treatment For Birthmarks

Several different treatments are available today. The main goal of any treatment is to shrink birthmark or remove it. 

## Medications

### Corticosteroids

Your pediatrician may prescribe a corticosteroid, orally, or as an injection. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs usually administered into the birthmark. That way, they are reducing the vessel size directly. 

### Beta-blockers

Beta-blockers are medications used for blood pressure regulation. They are effective in reducing the pressure in large raised vascular birthmarks, especially hemangiomas. Treatment will result in making birthmark shrank, softened, and smaller. The two main beta-blockers used in these situations are propranolol and timolol. Propranolol is administered orally and timolol topically.

## Laser therapy 

The mechanism of laser treatment consists of heat and light. When applied to a birthmark, it makes a birthmark smaller and lighter. It is most efficient when performed from 6 months to a year of age. 

If medications and laser therapy aren’t efficient enough, there’s always a third option - surgical removal.

## Birthmark Removal

A birthmark should be surgically removed if it’s affecting a person’s health or quality of life in any way. If you’re removing a birthmark because of the health issues, your insurance will most probably cover the costs. Removing birthmark for cosmetic reasons would be paid privately. Surgery is performed in an outpatient setting, rarely in the hospital. Larger birthmarks may be removed in sections, so the surgery is done during several appointments. The doctor will use a small scalpel to remove a birthmark under local anesthesia.

## How To Feel About All This

In conclusion, one may say that most of the birthmarks are harmless and do not require any attention what so ever. Still, there’s nothing wrong knowing all about them, is there? Birthmarks are cute, and they make your baby even more unique.
