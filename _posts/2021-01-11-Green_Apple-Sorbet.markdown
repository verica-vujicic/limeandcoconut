<drop-cap>S</drop-cap>orbet is a perfect dessert for those who love ice cream but sometimes find it too sweet. It's also a good choice for those who don't tolerate milk very well but don't want to admit it yet. 

Believe it or not, sorbet originates from Persia. These days every country has its version of it. Sorbet is usually made of fruit, sugar, and water. Some sorbet recipes also have wine or liqueur, and rarely - honey. 

Let's take a break from sugar and still have a nice sweet.

Meet the sorbet made of honey!

### **TIPS**

>Tip 1: Black locust honey is the best choice because it has an extra sweetness for sour frozen apples. However, if you don't have it, any other honey will do just as good.

>Tip 2: Try your sorbet right before putting it in the freezer. You can add some extra honey if it's too sour for you. Even if you're a big fan of sourness and acid fruits in general, you might want a bit more sweetness.

>Tip 3: It would be great if the sorbet could stay overnight in the freezer.
