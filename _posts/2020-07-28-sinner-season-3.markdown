<drop-cap>S</drop-cap>eason 3 of [The Sinner](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6048596/) is something of a perfect TV show to watch if you are in the quarantine or you spend way too much time at home. It debates about the meaning of life, and I know what you think right now. On no, another one? Our sinner here is more similar to any of us then any other confused-by-life-character I’ve seen or read. It is because the sinner is living a life very similar to mine, or yours. Did you ever feel like you had enough of your vacation or weekend, and you want that Monday to come (but oh mighty Lord, Mondays we hate) and to get back to work and to be yourself again? You go to work every day, go home to your partner, have a baby someday, cause that’s what you're supposed to do to have a good life. Eventually, you will die. So the sinner is aksing himself: why am I going to work every day? Why are me and my wife together? What will I tell my son when he asks: what’s the point of living if I'll most certainly die someday? And what if I jump off my comfortable, insured, irrelevant little life and do something that makes my day different? Now, imagine if that kind of psycho is under investigation by a detective whose demons are older and more disturbing than his.

The Sinner is a crime, drama, mystery TV Series provided by [USA Network](https://www.usanetwork.com/), with a current IMDb rating of 8.0. It is a set of stories of ordinary people who turn out to murderers. If you haven’t come across The Sinner before, you still may watch S03 first. Each season of The Sinner is a separate story with one character - detective Ambrose - present in all seasons. The Sinner TV Series has three seasons so far, with eight episodes each, and the fourth will be released in 2021. Keep in mind that S03 is the first recommended on Netflix. After you finish S03, it’ll pass you to S02 and then to S01.

After 18 years, Nick Haas visits his old friend from college Jamie in Dorchester. Jamie is living with a wife. They are expecting their first child. Three of them are having an awkward dinner, after which Nick and Jamie decide to go out for a drink. Detective Ambrose receives a call later that night about a car accident that happened at the resident Sonya Barzel property. Co-driver and only survivor Jamie Burns reported an accident. The driver Nick Haas died on the scene. The initial investigation found that a cell phone contains no fingerprints on it. Everything points to an intentional postponement of calling 911.  

Jessica Hecht, in the role of Sonya Barzel, is an artist and owner of the property where the accident happened. As expected for artistic souls, Sonya gives the impression that there is more to her than meets the eye. Throughout the whole season, there’s a feeling that she may know something relevant for the investigation or may affect it. Sometimes, it just seems like she has a complicated personality herself.

Bill Pulman (who will always be Mr. President from 1996 Independence Day) is Harry Ambrose detective in charge of an investigation on the car accident. After examining the crashed vehicle, Ambrose finds several details to be suspicious. He lives in his house in the woods all by himself. His daughter and grandson visit sometimes. Harry is one of those older and experienced detectives. He has his routines and doesn’t like to share work with anybody.

Like it or not, Harry works at the case with a colleague Vic Soto (Eddie Martinez), younger and enthusiastic ex-army detective. 

Leela Burns (Parisa Fitz-Henley) is Jamie’s wife, and she is expecting their first child. She is making and selling essential oils in a local store downtown.

Matt Bomer plays Jamie Burns, a high school teacher who just moved to a small town, a perfect place for starting a family. However, the more he builds his “perfect” life, the more miserable he becomes. What does it mean to live a perfect life anyway, and who set the criteria?

Nick Haas is Jamie’s friend, played by Chris Messina. According to his college professor, he is “a brilliant young man, a bit eccentric. You only find students of his caliber every once in a while”. Back in college, he was very much interested in Nietzsche’s consept known as Übermensch. He transffered his love toward philosophy to Jamie.

Übermensch is a philosophy concept postulated by a german philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The initial translation from german - Superman - was wrong in so many ways. Übermesch is not about super-man and certainly not about comic book character as a lot of people would represent it. A more appropriate translation would be above human as a strength beyond humanity.

Nietzsche wrote a book [Thus Spoke Zarathustra](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51893.Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra). The main character, Zarathustra, explains that the age of believing in God is over. People don’t respect God’s values anymore, as the nihilism was born. The idea of übermensch offers a new set of values to fight against nihilism. Those values may vary, but must be inspired by the love and everything good and creative in life. A man should strive to become an Übermensch, to create his own set of values that would separate his from ordinary folks. Unfortunately, Hitler and the Nazi regimen misused this concept to explain the power and superiority of the Germanic race. They even created a term for the rest of the human race - Untermenschen - people so not worthy they should be enslaved. Before he died, Nietzsche stated that he is a Polish, and not German. He said: “I am a pure-blooded Polish nobleman, without a single drop of bad blood, certainly not German blood.”

As the professor said: “The Übermensch creates its own morality. Nietzsche contends that our modern ways have led us to lose our faith. God is dead. It’s up to the Übermensch to forge new values to live by. It’s a challenge, one that requires will. And discipline.” 

Besides an IMDb genre classification, I would add a psychological thriller as the internal struggle is present all along. Every character is a complex and complicated person. Leela, for instance, tries to create her brand of essential oils, and she is looking for investors. Sonya has an unusual way to make preparations before the next painting project. Detective Ambrose seeks truth and tries to understand other people and himself. There is a veil of mystery on Jamie’s life, so a lot of room for assumptions is left. It is not always obvious does the character has some serious problems or not. Relationships are thus even more complex and are changing throughout the show. Sympathy turns into jealousy, and the protagonist may become a cruel antagonist.

The setting is in a small town with a woody suburb and cloudy days. That contributes to the overall mood. Sounds did not quite match the expectations since there is no soundtrack, rather intense music throughout the whole show. The intro sequence is an abstract animation, and it looks like the Rorschach test. However, this type of intros is part of a bunch of other TV shows (such as Mindhunter, Outsider), and it does not even have a soundtrack. On the other hand, frame compositions put character sideway, yet dramatizing what is going inside a person's head. Blurring frames also increases the feeling of what is happening inside of the character.

There's a part with a flashback when Jamie and Nick were in college. Young Jamie and Nick are played by different actors who do not look that much as older characters. Eighteen years is a long time between two life moments, but actors are not even the same height!

After watching The Sinner S03, there is a bittersweet feeling of victory and defeat at the same time. There is no excuse for the act of crime. With that said, when I see a man on the street, and I do not like him, his looks, his attitude, his manner of speaking, I’ll think about his life before making any judgments. It’s impossible to know is someone a victim of life, society, or another victim.
