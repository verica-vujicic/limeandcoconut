excerpt: "What is it like to have a baby during the COVID-19"
---
<drop-cap>T</drop-cap>hey are 35-years old husband and wife. A few years ago, the two successful programmers decided to have a baby. They have been a couple for more than 15 years. Last year they got their first baby - Maya. The three of them are now living in their home in a small city that’s currently under quarantine. Christine and Ben are about to share their best and worst experiences that happened in the year since the baby came. What has changed since the time they were “alone”? How do parents of a one-year-old cope with [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) and everything that’s going on right now?

**Q: When have you decided to have a child? What circumstances led to the decision?**

> **C**: I think I can say for both of us that we had this particular life moto. We wanted to see and experience life as much as we could before we get a baby because the baby means changing a lifestyle. Having a child is a very responsible job. There are rules you need to respect.

> **B**: I agree with Christine. We were very fulfilled by our travelings, parties, and general lifestyle. And then, we just got over it. It’s not that interesting to party anymore. We were ready to leave all that behind. I think we were very prepared for the baby when we started thinking about having one.

    It was only three of us the whole time, and yes, it is possible

**Q: What it’s like to have a baby in your life?**

> **C**: If we put aside this COVID situation, one may say that the first six months are super-easy. The baby only sleeps and eats. People were telling me that having a baby is a tough job. For the first six months, I didn’t understand them. I was already thinking about having more children. We were lucky that our baby usually didn’t have cramps, she didn’t wake us up at night that often. The older she is, the more demands she has. That’s normal. She is now crawling, jumping, throwing, licking, and squeezing things. She wanted more food, more affection, more everything. Maybe the most useful toy that we had for her, was this little swingy chair (which I highly recommend), we would place her there, adjust swing speed, put a timer, or even play music. While she was sleeping, I drank coffee, watched tv shows. Now she can fall, or hit her head on the table or swallow a small piece of anything. Babies have this super-power of making things around them extremely dangerous!

> **B**: A small baby is a happy baby. After some time, you’ll notice that she (Maya) is more active, and you get more active, too. You get used to it pretty soon.

**Q: Tell me more about your everyday life. Could you describe your typical day?**

> **C**: The key to success is to have a schedule. We have everything scheduled! Every action is well predefined and well organized (eating, sleeping, playing, outside walks).

> **B**: Our situation is not typical because of the COVID. I don’t know how it would be if I had to go to work every day and leave two of them alone. I am working from home. I’m always there to help to hold Maya or feeding her or bathing her. So, it’s not typical every-day-parents kind of thing. We’re not that tired as we should have been. Needless to say that there come days when you are tired, and the baby just has woke up and wants to play. But it’s not that hard if you expect that from the beginning.

<div class="aside-quote"><q>
    There was a time when I was not sure if I want kids
</q></div>

**Q: What do you think about the COVID situation? How did you get used to it?**

> **B**: This all COVID thing turned out to be very good for us since I work from home, and she is on maternity leave. On the other hand, we didn’t have that much help from others because of the quarantine. Although our city is under quarantine, I have no fears regarding COVID at all. We hear bad news every day, more and more people are getting infected, and it’s getting worse. Still, it doesn’t concern me. I don’t see it as the end of the world. A man should stay sane and positive to go through it.

> **C**: People shouldn’t panic. Just be aware of the COVID existence, and that’s good enough. Don’t touch other people, don’t kiss anyone. Use the mask from time to time. Wash your hands often. I wouldn’t even care that much if I didn’t have a baby. Nonetheless, things changed due to COVID. Because of the COIVD, our local pregnancy course is currently unavailable. I don’t know how my pregnancy and the first year would be if I had no previous education. Also, hospitals are full of infected people. I remember that every medical appointment I had was relevant to me.

**Q: You mentioned that you have some previous education on pregnancy and taking care of a newborn. Can you tell me more about that?**

> **C**: Pregnancy is something that separates you from the people who are not expecting a baby. The social factor is relevant for pregnant women. It’s nice to have that feeling of belonging somewhere. The environment you set for the baby is also crucial. The pregnancy course was so useful to me. I learned a lot, and I made a lot of friends. Yes, you have all the info about pregnancy and babies on the internet, but I didn’t quite know how to search for it. I didn’t even know what I needed to know since this was my first pregnancy. The course made it easy. Nurses were talking about their experiences and what to expect on the birth. This course prepared me to be a mother and act like one from the start. I didn’t need any help this year. It was only three of us the whole time, and yes, it is possible.

**Q: If you recall your opinion from two years ago on having a baby and how would that be, would you say that this life now is what you have expected?**

> **B**: This is just what I have expected. I imagined nothing different. There was no fear for me. You become a father, and you go with a flow, keep living every moment, and keep trying your best for your wife and baby. It becomes another sweet duty as going to work you enjoy. It clicks into your life. Yes, it changes your life, but you do not even notice it. Your family extends for an additional family member, and that is it. Very soon, it becomes old news. 

> **C**: There was a time when I was not sure if I want kids. When you think about it, you never cover details, rather have this global picture. I did have this main thought that when a baby comes, one thing is for sure - you will not be in the focus of your life anymore. Someone else will be, so the question was - are you ready to give that spot to someone else? Are you willing to forget about things that are relevant to you, to make compromises, to change your priorities? Are you ready to do all that with a smile on your face? If you are going to be grunty all day, think again. I see now that I was partially right. Priorities changes indeed, and someone else becomes the focus of your life. You have to be present all the time. However, there is something that I did not foresee. There is an interesting and educational [TV Series on Netflix called Babies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11744632/). In the first episode, they mention the x-factor, something special you feel when you get a baby. That is not measurable. It is unexplainable. You cannot put it on paper and do the pros and cons. I read somewhere about bonding between a mother and a child. The chemistry happens inside a pregnant woman's body. By the time the pregnancy is over, the mother and baby are already chemically connected. Mothers have an urge, an instinct to look after the baby, to love the baby unconditionally, to the moon and back. Yeah, nature covered it all, so you do not have to worry about anything.

**Q: Have the baby change your social life?**

> **C**: Definitely! My social life became my top priority for the first time in many years. It just pushed everything else aside. I made a lot of friends. My colleagues became very dear friends of mine. We would hang out all day long. We even started a music band as a side project at work, and I’m so not that kind of person. Many people told me that I changed and am more relaxed and open to hangouts and chit-chatting. Even strangers were so empathetic. They were trying to help, to ease everything for me, or to talk and to make my day. Our city has a lot of parents and kids. During our walks with Maya, we make a lot of acquaintances. We bond with people. On the other hand, my brain works slowlier. I’m supposed to return to work soon, and I’m kind of worried about that. My head is not the same. I’m not remembering and thinking as well as before.

**Q: Were there any stressful situations during the first year of the baby’s life?**

> **C**: There were three such situations. The first time, she fell off the couch when she was small, she was not six-months-old yet. We found her under the chair. I was stressed and shaking. A few months later, she fell off of her 1.5 meters high bed. She was crying and shaking like never before, and I was out of my mind, but everything was fine. Then right about the time when COVID started, we found out that her iron level in blood was too low. I was so afraid. Imagine you need to take your 6-months-old to the hospital every day with COVID running around. Fortunately, she got iron syrup, and that resolved soon afterward.

> **B**: I have to admit, I do not see any of that so intimidating. Christine  worries a bit too much. I think it’s got something to do with those chemicals she mentioned before. Mothers worry too much, sometimes beyond reason. Fathers do not have that feeling right from the start but develop during the time. I know that the child will fall off the bike, and will hurt their hands, and bruised their knee or head, or even break something. I see that as expected and completely normal thing to happen.

<div class="aside-quote"><q>
    Just keep your eyes on the goal, stick to it, and everything will be ok as always does
</q></div>

**Q: Did the relationship between you two change since you became parents?**

> **B**: We are together since highschool. We have known each other pretty well, and our relationship went through a lot before the baby. So the baby just made us closer. From now on, I’ll need to think about my daughter, too. I mean, imagine if I want a divorce for any reason. Divorce would not mean leaving a wife, but also a daughter. It’s another dimension of seeing things. A baby is somehow keeping everything more tightly. It’s like a project on which you’re working together. You have to be a team, because if you’re not, life may be difficult. Christine and I worked that out a long before the baby came.

**Q: Do you have any message for future parents?**

> **B**: Pregnancy and the baby changed my wife. She is more positive, more optimistic about everything. From the day she found out about the pregnancy, she is so happy. Yes, she had previous education on everything, and that probably made things easier. Nonetheless, if she was pregnant today, I think that the result would be just the same - we’ll have a baby. Just keep your eyes on the goal, stick to it, and everything will be ok as always does.


Dear Christine and Ben, thank you! Your love is guidance!
