excerpt: "What does the average day at the Coliving residence in Lisbon look like?"
---
<drop-cap>I</drop-cap>f you look up the internet, you may find a definition of Coliving as such: "Coliving is a residential community living model that accommodates three or more biologically unrelated people living in the same dwelling unit, facilitated by a professional host."

One may compare renting a hotel apartment and a Coliving apartment, but these don't really have much in common.
Coliving is a way of living with other random people from all over the world, sharing your living spaces (kitchen, office, dining room, etc.) for some time.Â 

Say you'd like to try Coliving and search the internet to find the desired destination that offers the Coliving concept of life. Believe it or not, Serbia also has Coliving offers (two different residences in the north - Vojvodina). Of course, by the end of the article, you'll see that (if you live in Serbia) there's no point in visiting Serbian Coliving space.

**Coliving in Lisbon**

A couple of years ago (2022), I went to Lisbon with two friends to try out their Coliving residence called [<em>Samesame</em>](https://www.samesameliving.com/). At first, it seemed like any other residential building. There were a couple of rooms and apartments available. However, you can book accommodation for a couple of months (two or three) and more, but no less than that. Our apartment had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a large living room with a dining area, and a kitchen. This space is located in the center of Portugal's capital. The architecture of the building is beautiful: high ceilings, beautiful simple European interior design, huge windows, with the view of the Samesame's restaurant from one side and street covered in Portuguese tiles on the other. On the bed, little welcoming gifts were waiting for us (handmade soap, bag, stickers, map, and leaflets). The host invited us to the dinner. Soon enough, we were added to the WhatsApp group, where all announcements were sent.Â 

**What did an average day look like?**

In the morning, we would get coffee and snack at the local place next to the Samesame. An older couple was running their small business. They had just a few sandwiches on the menu, a coffee, a Portuguese beverage called ginja (<em>Ä‘inÄ‘a</em>), and some bottled juices. This sandwich (<em>bifana</em>) was made of shredded pork and flatbread, and that was pretty much it. But it was tasteful and cheap, and the service was so nice it felt like home. The funny thing about breakfast in Portugal is that people often eat just flatbread and a shot of ginja for breakfast, which was strange even to people from Serbia. They would eat, standing, and, the next minute, they'd be on their way. However, Portuguese people are pleasant, chill, and generally very kind. They do not hurry - ever, they live as if there is all the time in the world for them, but are not obsessed with food, they won't spend a lot of time making it, and their meal size is half as we're used to in Serbia.

Considering the quality of the raw foods at the store, no wonder they are not trying harder to create more delicious meals. Fruits and vegetables at the store smelled of flowers, and any meat was just soft and juicy, no matter how you treated it. Whatever we cooked, it was just amazing.

Their wines are a whole other story. Dry or sweet, fruity or not, they were all great (not to mention that all wines we tried were around 2 to 3 EUR a bottle). Different stores had different prices, but in stores near us, prices for everything (food, liquor, spices, etc.) were generally lower than those in Belgrade, at that time.

After breakfast, it was time to get some work done, and we would head to Samesame's office. The office was commodious with architecture in the same manner as apartments (high ceilings, etc.), with pro desks and office chairs with conference rooms and all office material necessary (printers, paper, not to mention internet and other essentials).Â 

Sometimes we worked from Starbucks, especially on Wednesdays when a cleaning lady was visiting our apartment (it was always at the same time - Wednesday from 1 to 2 pm). Lisbon is a great city with an annual average temperature of 21Â°C during the day. The city of seven hills lies on the Atlantic coast, with numerous artistic squares and simple ways of transportation, as it is in the rest of Europe. Metro, electric scooters, and tramways were our primary choices. People from Samesame residence would communicate through the WhatsApp group and go together to tour the city, visit a music store, or get a drink at a nice local bar someone found on the g-maps.

If you were wondering if it's possible to live and work from Portugal, considering taxes and legal obligations, Portugal offers a digital nomad visa which basically covers it all. This visa allows you to live and work in Portugal legally. In addition, income from foreign sources is not taxed at all, while domestic income is taxed at a 20% rate, which is great. More information about this can be found on [this website](https://brighttax.com/blog/portugal-digital-nomad-visa/#:~:text=Income%20generated%20from%20foreign%20sources,is%20taxed%20at%20just%2020%25.).

Once a week, we would receive, via WhatsApp, an art program and food menu for the upcoming week. Almost every night, there was a concert, recitation, or gig going on, and the place for the gathering was Samesame's restaurant called Insitu. It is a nice cozy place where everyone comes together to chit-chat, drink coffee, or just pause from work. We would sit on the tabourets, pillows, or other stuff, with low tables.Â 

Food was served every day around 1.30 pm, and there was always a message on WhatsApp when the food was ready. The Samesame had its chef, and the food was delicious. It was probably the best food I've tried in Lisbon. Made of meat and vegetables in many different ways, it was something new to us, meals you can't find in Serbia.Â

Once a week, every Tuesday, dinner would be made by someone from Samesame's residence. It was all voluntary, of course, but everyone, at the time we were there, participated. So, one Tuesday, the three of us volunteered. We decided to make stuffed peppers (<em>punjene paprike</em>) in our way for fellow Coliving people. We spent the day in the Insitu's kitchen hanging out with Samesamers, drinking, having fun, and preparing our 21 stuffed peppers for 21 guests. Needless to say, they were happy with our meal. Although shocked at first by the meal size, most of them ate it all and even found room for our dessert - rice pudding (<em>sutlijaÅ¡</em>).

Last night in Lisbon, we had a kind of goodbye party, we ate, drank, and laughed, and headed to catch an airplane at 4 am.

Leaving the apartment, we looked back one more time and realized we had papaya and passion fruit on the table, signed CDs from the local gigs and other souvenirs in pockets, and dozens of new friends (to whom we still communicate to this day), Portuguese tiles and ginja in the backpack, sweet memories,Â

and we didn't want to go home.
