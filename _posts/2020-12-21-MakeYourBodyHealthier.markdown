<drop-cap>T</drop-cap>he cold doesn’t have to be painful, or at least, not always. Regardless of whether you’re a winter person or not, these tips and tricks can help you adapt to the cold winter days. The cold can even make you healthier, just like the gym workouts.

December is coming to an end, and coronavirus is still on the loose. By the time your workday is over, all gyms and stores are closed. Fear of losing shape and social life is rising. And what about outdoor winter activities? Are we all going to sleep through it all?

The answer is - no. Professors, trainers, and experts found ways to overcome the cold. They also established strategies to adapt easier to cold weather and be healthier by chilling outside during the cold day.

## Reasons To Try

According to physiology professor at the University of Oregon, Dr. Christopher Minson, humans enjoy the warmth and don’t like temperature oscillations in the system. Getting out of your comfort zone is a challenge for the whole body. In the cold, the blood vessels constrict, the metabolic rate is a bit higher, and the heart works faster. That way, every cell is pushed to work a little more than usual, just like during the exercise.

## How To Do It?

You don’t need a coach nor the equipment to reach a goal here. All you have to do is take an outside walk. Go outside in light clothes several times a day. Expose yourself to the cold. Feel the cold and embrace it without resisting it. At home, take a shower. At the end of it, turn the water cold and hold it for 30 seconds. If that’s too much for you, begin with 10 seconds and then increase timing by 5 seconds each day.

## Suggestion For Training At Home

To start your home exercise, begin with buying a timer because things are about to get wet. During the first week, start showering with cold water for 15 seconds. If you start to shiver, stop the exercise and warm-up. Shivering is a form of muscle contraction, so the muscle produces additional heat energy for supporting the body. The next week try to lengthen the cold part of the shower for 5 or 10 seconds. The shivering will become rarer and eventually disappear as the brain adapts to these new conditions. Every week add 5 to 10 seconds until you can perform the whole showering process with cold water. Be patient and be determined.

If you can not tolerate cold water, don’t worry. Simply take a long walk outside every day, as often as possible. Just remember not to put up too many clothes.

## Go Pro

Dave Whitley is a coach and motivational speaker who practices cold exposure as part of his daily routine. His showers are cold, and water is nearly freezing in his outdoor shed. Although cold water seems unbearable at first, at the end of the process, it becomes pleasant, he says. Adapting to the cold takes practice and commitment.

If you liked the beginner training, you can always test your limits. Since humans tolerate cold air much better than cold water, start with the land exercises. Wearing shorts in 4-degree-celsius weather, holding hands under freezing water, or wearing ice packs on the back of the neck are just some of the methods. Extremists take a bath in a tub filled with ice cubes or ice blocks. But let’s not go there.

## What does science have to say?

Lithuanian scientists researched cold water effects in 2014 over a group of 14 male volunteers who spend up to three hours a day in 13-degrees celsius cold water. The experiment lasted for three weeks and showed hyperventilation, a decrease in heart rate, delayed immune system response, improved attention, and memory. A similar study was conducted several years later, but this time with 12 young volunteers who agreed to spend 10 minutes a day in cold water. The outcome was the same, and the study author, Dr. Marius Brazaitis, admitted that he felt a little guilty for the exhausting methodology of the first study.

This finding supports the theory of cold water showering. Dr. Brazaitis argued that you can adapt by starting with higher temperatures and then decreasing it day by day so the temperature would be lower and the time spent longer.

## It’s Not Good For Everyone

Exposure to cold conditions isn’t for everyone. In the beginning, the cold can weaken your immune system, so you’d be more susceptible to infections. Patients with cardiovascular and similar medical conditions should be more careful. The elderly also have a lower tolerance to the cold.

In conclusion, there’s nothing you can lose by taking a shower with a colder ending. This type of exercise shouldn’t compromise your health and wellness, so if you start to notice any undesired effects such as sore throat or fever, quit the training and postpone it for some better times. If you feel good while practicing, that's great! Just remember not to overdo it. Go step by step, and feel the body changing.
