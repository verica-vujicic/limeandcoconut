<drop-cap>P</drop-cap>eanut butter and strawberry jelly make a great combination well known in the west. But these Italian cookies are more sophisticated and are so delicious, you could serve them to the Royal queen and not be embarrassed. Peanut butter cookies are rich in taste and go well with coffee, tea, or alone. Although they are made of peanut butter and honey, these cookies are easy to swallow. One round makes 17 to 20 cookies depending on dough thickness and the size of the cookie mold. Once you try it, soon you'll see that one round is just never enough.

### **INGREDIENTS**

- 75 g peanut butter
- 1 tbsp honey
- 125 g butter
- 100 g powdered sugar
- 225 g flour
- 200 g strawberry jelly

### **DIRECTIONS**

<step>
Mix peanut butter, honey, butter, and confectioners' sugar. Cookies will be better if the ingredients are combined using a silicone spatula instead of a mixer. But, if you're running out of time, a mixer will do. Add flour and mix it.
</step>

<step>
Now it's time to roll out the dough. Place your dough between two baking sheets with waxed sides touching the dough. If you have the regular baking sheet, just sprinkle it with flour. Place your stretched dough in the fridge for one hour. On halfway through, turn on the oven to 170C. 
</step>

<step>
When the time's up, take your dough, remove one paper sheet and start pulling hearts. Take out around 34 heart-shaped cookies (4-5 cm in diameter). Take half of them and use smaller heart-shaped mold (approximately 2-3 cm in diameter) to have 17 hollowed hearts.
</step>

<step>
Bake them for around 10 to 13 minutes. While baking them, keep an eye on your cookies. They are very sensitive to temperature and baking duration. They are supposed to be golden brown.
</step>

<step>
Let them cool. Spread a strawberry jam on the flat side of the compact heart and join it with a flat side of hollowed heart. Repeat the process until you're out of cookies. 
</step>

Hopefully, you'll not be literally out of cookies before you finish them. 


Yes, they are that good.

### **TIPS**

> Tip 1: Take butter and peanut butter out of the fridge about an hour before making cookies and leave them somewhere warm so they would soften.

> Tip 2: To make sure you roll the dough evenly, use two mixing spoons, and place the dough between them. Then roll the dough so it would be the same height as mixing spoons. If the mixing spoons are too big, roll the dough the same way, remove the mixing spoons, and roll it just a bit more.

> Tip 3: The fridge will make dough cold and firm. The first several minutes will be the easiest for pulling out the cookies, so make it count.
