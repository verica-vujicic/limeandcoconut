<drop-cap>K</drop-cap>osmaj mountain lies in central Serbia, just south of Belgrade. Kosmaj is 626 m above sea level and has a nickname that shares with Avala mountain - "Belgrade mountain." It lies in a beautiful Serbian subregion known as Sumadija ("suma" means forest in Serbian). 

The mountain resides 58 km from Belgrade, 71 km from Kragujevac, and 149 km from Novi Sad. If you live in central Serbia, this is a perfect idea for the weekend or even an afternoon ride, alone or with a family.

[The map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=13reG38meBXkGlPM2NKOIpeUNVjMEGPEb&ll=44.48714241478879%2C20.533426225075697&z=15) has a route with Belgrade as a starting point.

With six sites visited, the whole road trip lasted for six hours with eight stops for coffees, cookies, chitchats with villagers, beers, and sausages. The road trip plan is an adjustable and safe route with a short cultivated off-road section around the Kastaljan monastery.


## 1. Lake and Hunting Ground - Tresnja

[Tresnja](https://www.google.com/search?q=jezero+tresnja&client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALeKk036sVXdd6tQ3kRWTjvWWXIXpJqxjA:1609769758284&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiE9fLUu4LuAhWEPewKHZntDMEQ_AUoAXoECAUQAw&biw=1440&bih=837) is an artificial lake initially created as a water reservoir used for extinguishing fires in nearby woods. Located in the community Mala Ivanca between Avala and Kosmaj mountains, the lake is 150 meters long and 30 meters wide. Terrain under the oak trees is rich in black truffles. Tresnja lake has also been immortalized by a scene from a movie [Marathoners run the lap of honor](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084302/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_21).

## 2. Utesiteljevo Church and Monastery

Utesiteljevo church and monastery are part of [The Serbian True Orthodox Chuch (STOC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_True_Orthodox_Church) and lie nearby Ralja, south of Belgrade. They are a loose group of Orthodox churches that resist ecumenism and other attempts of modernization within the mainstream churches. The construction began in 2012 and is still ongoing. This small beautiful complex also has a souvenir shop with homemade soaps, hand creams, and essential oils. People are nice and hospitable, and nature is preserved.

## 3. Tresije Monastery

[Tresije monastery](https://www.google.com/search?q=tresije+monastery&client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALeKk0384v5IZH2rTYEdWExnkGkt03U86g:1609775305350&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjT-fip0ILuAhVEPewKHZWtA9kQ_AUoAXoECAYQAw&biw=1440&bih=837) is the next checkpoint on the route. Tresija is dedicated to the Holy Archangels Mihail and Gavrilo. The monastery was built in the thirteen century, during the reign of [king Dragutin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Dragutin). Due to wars, Tresija shared a similar fate as many other churches and monasteries in Serbia, it was demolished and built several times. The establishment is named after the nearby water brook of the same name.

## 4. Kastaljan Monastery and Archeological Site

The archeological site at Kosmaj mountain known as Kastaljan is an amazing discovery of [Kasteljan monastery remains](https://beogradskonasledje.rs/kd/zavod/sopot/manastir-kastaljan.html). Archeologists believe Kastaljan was built in the fourteen century during the reign of King Dragutin (same as the Tresija monastery). At that time, Kosmaj had the role of a large religious center.

Thick stone walls and numerous window and door frames extend to hundreds of meters. As a monument of exceptional values, Kastaljan describes the period of [despot Stefan Lazarević](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Lazarević), and the power and wealth of the Serbian country during the middle age. 
 
 
## 5. The Monument to Kosmaj Partisan Devision

The most popular attraction is [the monument to Kosmaj partisan division](https://www.google.com/search?q=kosmaj+monument&client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALeKk01vn09QjggLNOzBUW-4b4cU6m2WFg:1609777439142&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwixrrWj2ILuAhWRCuwKHebMC1oQ_AUoAXoECBIQAw&biw=1440&bih=837) from world war II on the top of Kosmaj mountain. It was built in 1971 as a symbol of freedom and the eternal flame of those who fell during WWII. The base is 18 m wide. The monument consists of five concrete arms 30 meters high. Soon after sculptor Vojin Stojić and architect Gradimir Medaković revealed the statue, it became a sign of recognition of the Kosmaj area.

    "The middle ages monasteries were built on a day of the horse ride from each other"
</q></div>

Svetolik Busarac, trip advisor and co-founder of the 4x4 Serbia Crew association, says that the middle ages monasteries were built on a day of the horse ride from each other, so the travelers would always have a place to stay during the night. No wonder there are so many monasteries and churches in such close range here on Kosmaj, says he.

## 6. Kabinet Brewery

[Kabinet Brewery](https://www.kabinet.rs/index.php/en) is located in the village called Nemenikuce. It's in the middle of nowhere, and there are no signs to it, nor the other way around. From the outside, it looks like a container for cement and other construction material. But once you enter the place, you won't get out. The brewery has one side in glass and is open to the Sumadija and further. The view is extraordinary.

In regards to the menu, they have the whole thing. Appetizers, salads, sausages, chopped beef - you name it. And, of course, sixteen types of delicious crafted beer are something you never tasted before. There is also a souvenir shop where you can buy a T-Shirt, a special new year's edition of the four-pack beer, or any other Kabinet beer you like!


During the whole trip, you'd come up to a beautiful view spot or an observation point. Kosmaj is a real natural treasure, so make yourself comfortable and enjoy it all the way.


And when you feel like you've seen enough, sit at the edge of the world and take a pint of refreshing home-brewed beer.

Cheers!
