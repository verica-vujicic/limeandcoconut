<drop-cap>N</drop-cap>eedless to say that 2020 was a challenging and unpredictable year. Yet, it brought a few nice things with it. We spent more time with family and friends than ever, so I decided to make birthday presents instead of buying them. Here is my list of gifts which you can make for your friends. The recipe is simple: a little bit of time, a pinch of imagination, and lots and lots of love.

## 1. Painting

Paintings are beautiful and simple gifts to make. It is an artistic and eternal souvenir and modern choice for a gift. If you don’t have any idea what you would paint, [check out the internet](https://www.google.com/search?q=diy+paintings&client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALeKk03362OTABeH99avAEbq3bMSxPPEAw:1609602960906&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjG3dqlzv3tAhURqaQKHaAtBywQ_AUoAXoECBQQAw&biw=1440&bih=837), it has a lot to offer, although it would be much prettier if you could remember something about your friend or friendship in general and draw that. Find more about the [colors and technics](https://www.pinterest.com/diyboards/diy-canvas-art/) before starting a project, define your style. If you’re afraid you wouldn’t do it right, remember that the final result doesn’t matter. What matters is your time, effort, and love you put into that canvas and for your friend.

## 2. Wood Plank Art

If you don't have a canvas, there are many different surfaces you can put your drawing on. In my case, I used an old and unusable wood out of which I created planks and connected them with ropes. Material is irrelevant. However, wood has a special effect, especially after covering painting with a varnish that makes your work even more pretty. My best friend enjoys cocktails, so I made the recipe board for her, but you can paint everything that comes to your mind.

## 3. Decoupage

Speaking of the paintings and wood art, keep in mind that you can create a decoupage craft on the canvas or on any unusable object you find in your house. To make a decoupage on the wood, you would need some basic decoupage tools. However, if you don’t have it, don’t worry. There are several [decoupage technics](https://www.google.com/search?q=decoupage+tutorial&source=lmns&bih=837&biw=1440&client=safari&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjopKPdz_3tAhWWOuwKHazlCjgQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA) made of tools every home has. If you have tissue paper with some cute symbol, you’re good to go.

## 4. Jewelry 

Jewelry may be a perfect gift for girls, but boys too. Everyone has a bunch of old pearls, rocks, ribbons, chains, and beads. Don’t forget that there are so many ways to make a necklace. You can use whatever you have at home: paperclips, wool, or any other material. Hair accessories are also an option. Make a pile of found material, play with colors, and let your hands do the rest.

## 5. Scarf

Winter is coming indeed, and knitting is one relaxing and enjoyable activity. It reminds me of Serbian culture and the importance of the family. Our grandmas used to make all sorts of clothing out of wool and similar material. There is an enormous number of different, colorful, and beautiful wools, textiles, and fibers. Technics may vary, but you can find on the internet [simple ways of making scarves](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&bih=837&biw=1440&hl=en&sxsrf=ALeKk02jghXrnsa1w-Uf7E-MP8PdjY43qQ%3A1609603349296&ei=FZnwX8zFEenBlAbe97bwCQ&q=knitting+tutorial+for+beginners&oq=knitting+tutorial+&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMgoIABDJAxAUEIcCMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAOgcIIxDqAhAnOgQIIxAnOggIABDJAxCRAjoFCAAQkQI6CAguEMcBEKMCOggILhDHARCvAToECAAQQzoCCC46BQgAEMkDOgQIABAKOgcIABDJAxBDOgcIABAUEIcCULXuAVjdkwJgtZsCaAJwAXgAgAGiAYgBtA-SAQQxMC45mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdperABCsABAQ&sclient=psy-ab) (or any other piece of clothing). I covered the course in several days (practicing approximately a couple of hours a day). My first scarf had some holes, but the second one was already perfect! If you’re intrigued by this story, give it a try.

## 6. Board Game

Making a board game is a challenging task to do. I made a Scrabble game for my sister, and it was a hell of a job. The game has three elements: a hundred wooden tiles with letters, a game board, and two wooden holders for tiles. Also, it would be magnificent if you could print out game rules available on the internet.

## 7. Cakes and Cookies

Cookies are a lovely way to show someone appreciation. Making cookies is super easy. All you need to do is pick [a recipe that you feel comfortable making](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&bih=837&biw=1440&hl=en&sxsrf=ALeKk02pS5AaiO2amSS6w1w-u6-oxJqH5g%3A1609603465977&ei=iZnwX-uAO6f5sAfNwLWYCg&q=easy+recipes+cookies&oq=easy+recipes+cookies&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCAAQyQMyAggAMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjoECAAQRzoHCAAQyQMQQzoECAAQQzoHCAAQFBCHAjoICAAQyQMQkQJQ6BFYlhlgshxoAHACeACAAWeIAeoFkgEDNy4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBB8ABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwir6cWW0P3tAhWnPOwKHU1gDaMQ4dUDCAw&uact=5). From my experience, the only thing you should know is whether your friend is a chocolate fan or a fruit lover. I have this habit of making cakes for birthdays and cookies for all other occasions, although that’s not exclusively. If you want to put a bow on the top of the box, the best choice would be smaller cookies, such as chocolate chip cookies.

You can always write a poem or a short story, record or perform a recitation or play the verse out on the guitar, or sing that thing! But most importantly, remember that there are no rules in regards to what or how you are going to make something. Everyone adores handmade gifts. 

**So free your mind.** 

**And enjoy!**
