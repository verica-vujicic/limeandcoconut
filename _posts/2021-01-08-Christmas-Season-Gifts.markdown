## 1. Calendar

Since it is the beginning of a new (hopefully better) year, this may be a perfect gift for this time of the year. Spear a few hours at the computer and create a calendar in Pages or MS Word. 

There are already [patterns available for 2021](https://www.google.com/search?q=2021+months+calendar&client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALeKk00O6rMave4rGWJ-Xj9JotRvVm8-gA:1610107342172&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjU97ehpYzuAhWl3OAKHdUFAowQ_AUoAXoECBAQAw&biw=1440&bih=837). You can also find pages for each month, but you can make months any way you like. If you are going to use the pattern for each month separately, you may also add an image for each month. Find pictures of the moments you shared with your friend and pick one for every month.

The previous year was all about the distance. If you lack in photos, you can use some other pictures not related to your friendship. Say your friend is a fan of Salvador Dali. Use [Dali's paintings](https://www.google.com/search?q=salvador+dali+paintings&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwijr6mipYzuAhUMyRoKHZPnDacQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=salvador+dali+&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoECCMQJzoECAAQQ1DCnARY5qsEYOi1BGgAcAB4AIAByAGIAegLkgEFNy42LjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=0En4X6OHAYySa5PPt7gK&bih=837&biw=1440&client=safari) instead of photos.

Spirals are a good choice for merging months. They make a calendar look more pro. However, other methods work just as well.

## 2. Homemade book

A [photobook](https://www.google.com/search?q=photo+book+diy&client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALeKk03R-Wyqh1RBuzdwt-3Z_RN9g0OATg:1610107573884&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj88faPpozuAhUZ7eAKHROhBIoQ_AUoAXoECB8QAw&biw=1440&bih=837) is another great idea that you can make in no time. As a holiday season gift, a photobook gives additional meaning to the images, moments you shared, and places you visited. Abstract the most precious and hilarious images of the past year and make a document of it, so you can easily print it out. Use waxed or other specific paper for photobooks.

If you have a cocktail lover among friends, a [cocktail recipe book](https://www.google.com/search?q=cocktail+book+recipes+diy&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwimuN6QpozuAhVKYBoKHSHxDXgQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=cocktail+book+recipes+diy&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoGCAAQBxAeOggIABAHEAUQHjoICAAQCBAHEB46BAgjECc6BAgAEEM6AggAOgYIABAIEB5Qjb8BWIHiAWCZ4wFoAHAAeACAAdkBiAGEGpIBBzIwLjEyLjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=t0r4X-aAI8rAaaHit8AH&bih=837&biw=1440&client=safari) may be a much better option. Take several [cocktail recipes](https://www.google.com/search?q=cocktail+recipes&source=lmns&bih=837&biw=1440&client=safari&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjTo--qpozuAhVP_4UKHR-vDTQQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA) they'll most certainly like, or add personal favorites of theirs if you know it. Put it alongside some nice cocktail glass set, and they are going to be delighted.

## 3. Facemask Chains

Corona is still among us, and nobody knows for how long it's going to stay that way. In other words, it seems like we are going to wear masks for a long time. For those who have to wear a mask all day long, especially inside, here is one amazing gadget you can make. It's so practical and pretty you will make one for yourself too! Facemask chains! All you need to have are chains or pearls and a couple of lobster claws or spring rings.

## 4. Friend Made Of Wire

If you have a canvas too small for a regular painting and you don't know what to do with it, here's how you can use it! All you'll need is a small canvas, little paint (optional), and wire. The wire should be thin and easy to shape. 

The final product you are looking for is the shape of someone or something made out of wire and tied onto the canvas. Find a nice picture of your friend, print it out, and cut off the part you want.

For instance, if you're making someone's face out of wire, you'd cut off the face. It doesn't have to be a person, it may be a beloved dog or a car. Love works in mysterious ways. 

Place a cropped picture on the painted canvas (or leave it white) and sew the wire up into canvas right by the edges of the cropped picture. In the end, fix the wire so it wouldn't move, and that's it.

## 5. Wall Clock

To make a wall clock, you'll need a part that cannot be homemade. It's a clock mechanism. Some book stores sell clock mechanisms without numbers. Just a black round part in the middle for the wall, so you can make numbers around it by yourself.

[The Internet](https://www.google.com/search?q=wall+clock+diy&client=safari&hl=en&sxsrf=ALeKk00j_fQayihonrU2je78QGBNsN3f5w:1610107661554&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjb8t25pozuAhWl2eAKHQmLBj0Q_AUoAXoECCAQAw&biw=1440&bih=837) also covered a bunch of ideas on how to make numbers for this kind of clock. It can be out of the books, CDs, pictures, quotes, or paint on the wall. Or, if you have a math lover or "a math lover," you can make a clock with math equations instead of a number, so a friend would have to try harder to see the time. At least he'll try a bit harder until he or she gets used to it. It'd be fun.

## 6. Cookies

In the end, there are, of course, cookies. The holiday season is filled with cakes and cookies, so you can relax and make small and pretty ones. 

Small buttery cookies for the coffee are a good example. They are simple to make, you don't have to make a lot of them, and they're beautiful for the eye. Besides, you can place them in [a cute box](https://www.google.com/search?q=cookies+in+box+diy&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjeo6_ipozuAhUI1IUKHZ3FC8oQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=cookies+in+box+diy&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQA1CeHViRIGCYI2gAcAB4AYABbogB7QOSAQMzLjKYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=Ykv4X97qLoiolwSdi6_QDA&bih=837&biw=1440&client=safari&hl=en) and put a bow on top of it.

Orthodox Christians are celebrating the holiday season by fasting during particular days in January. If you need a cookie for such times, here is a recipe for a traditional Turkish specialty - baklava. Check out the recipe [here](http://limeandcoconut.site/recipes/2021/01/08/Baklava.html).

## Conclusion

In the end, don't forget to write a note, or [a quote](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALeKk02CxZX6CemXyMEqNc34X7O-ktp2-g%3A1610107802891&ei=mkv4X7n6NaLlgwemw67gAw&q=quotes+for+christmas&oq=quotes+for+chris&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMgUIABDJAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoECAAQRzoECCMQJzoHCAAQyQMQQzoECAAQQzoFCAAQkQI6BwgAEBQQhwJQoxRY5zVglz1oAHACeACAAYUBiAGtCJIBAzIuOJgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQjAAQE&sclient=psy-ab), and your wishes. Just out of fun, you can throw a couple of Corona beers and make your gift even more interesting and fun. 

There's a tough year behind us and an unknown one ahead. That's good for the start, and we should celebrate!

<br/>

Lime & Coconut wishes you all the best for 2021!
