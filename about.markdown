Welcome to the ultimate place for fun and relaxation, a place of all sorts of things like books, movies, drugs, food, drinks, road trips, and lifestyle, stuff you can make yourself. Did I forget to mention a short tale section? Yep, and those are always in Serbian. The idea was to read something funny, cultural, or educational while enjoying morning coffee on Mondays. Some stories are structured, but most of them are not, and most of them have information not solely focused on the subject. I believe the only way to remember something is by reading a story about it and not just bare information. If you have any comments or have an idea what I could write about, please don't be shy, those questions and suggestions are the reason why L&C was created in the first place.

My name is Verica Stanisic, and I'm a creator of the L&C blog. If you like the content, you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/limeandcoconut)!

Limes and coconuts for everyone!
