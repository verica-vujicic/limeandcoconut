Most importantly, you'll find a tale of ordinary folk. You wouldn't believe how many genius and amazing people you may be surrounded by every day. It's almost not imaginable of all the little things they've done for each other. Or big things, so obvious and yet so unrevealed for the rest of the world. The treasure may lie in something huge as overcoming an illness or something small as understanding the movie or creating a brand new recipe that will warm your heart when you need it. You certainly have numerous incredible and unbelievable life stories yourself! Maybe you've forgotten your coconuts, or don't want to remember where you put those, sore as hell, limes. However, if you have a story to share, L&C would be more than happy to hear it.

Limes and coconuts for everyone!
